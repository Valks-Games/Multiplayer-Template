# Sandbox2
Testing out stuff in Godot C# and also figuring out a cross project library workflow.

Clone project with modules
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Valks-Games/Sandbox2
```

Update submodules (may not be required, I don't have enough experience to say for sure)
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
