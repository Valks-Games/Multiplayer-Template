# GodotUtils Netcode Template
Formely use to be a sandbox testing ground for GodotUtils library (and still is) but is now primarily for a starting project multiplayer template.

## Setup
Clone project with modules
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Valks-Games/Sandbox2
```

Update submodules (may not be required, I don't have enough experience to say for sure)
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
